# Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to create a lookup for users to find the five day forcast for a city of their choice.

# How to use the project

On the left side of the page, you will be able to search for the five day forecast for a city of your choice.
Enter in the city (or hit the current location button) and hit the search button
The five day forecast will show up on the right hand of the screen
In addition, it will track your locations that you have searched.

# Code highlights

I had the location button automatically running the script to get the 5 day forecast, however, it felt like just entering in the city was a better experience. I kept the code in to do this and commented it out.

# Areas of improvement

There is an error when you enter in the same city that needs to get fixed.
There is also an error if you do not enter anything in the search input box that needs to get fixed.
